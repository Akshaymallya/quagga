quagga-0.97.0

* Router advertisement syntax is changed. In usual cases (if you didn't do
  any fancy stuff) it's enough to change lines in configuration from:
  "ipv6 nd prefix-advertisement X:X:X:X::/X 2592000 604800 autoconfig on-link"
  to:
  "ipv6 nd prefix X:X:X:X::/X"

  All router advertisement options are documented in texi documentation.
