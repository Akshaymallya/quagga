  [ Michael Larson ]
  * fix for static interface and static nexthop routes for quagga. Now
    respects cable pull (IFF_RUNNING) events and admin (IFF_UP) events.
  * initial check-in of watchlink project. compiles, runs and manages
    state. needs additional testing and updates
  * removed unnecessary files.
  * packaging and make rules for base vyatta-quagga project to build
    watchlink
  * Added quagga like features to watchlink pgm: standard pid file
    creation and background option. Also
  * hooks to start/stop watchlink daemon with quagga
  * create directory for watchlink to store link status
  * moved creation of linkstatus directory from postinst to preinst
    where it should be.
  * cleaned up source a bit. added syslog error messages. added legal-

    needs to be be written to exclude

    downgraded syslog entry to
  * added empty exclude file creation to make watchlink happy
  * fix bug introduced with ptp support--indexing of database and
    initialization of terminating address.
  * fix for bc addr and fix for parsing iface for show cmds and filter
  * need to qualify test for non-ethernet type interfaces to
    newlink/dellink messages only.
  * moved some stderr messages to syslog. removed stderr message when
    receiving ack from kernel on netlink msg.
  * modified watchlink to manage connected routes in local and main
    tables per interface rather than pulling interface address on cable
    pull event.
  * force so_recvbuf size to 223232 (double of 111616) for netlink in
    zebra. will also need to modify
  * fix for bug 2750. will also submit to quagga dvlprs.
